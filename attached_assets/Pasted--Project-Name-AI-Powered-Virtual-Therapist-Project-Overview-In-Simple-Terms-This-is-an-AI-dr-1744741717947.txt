🧠 Project Name: AI-Powered Virtual Therapist
🚀 Project Overview (In Simple Terms)
This is an AI-driven mental health assistant that works like a virtual therapist/chatbot. It helps people check in on their mental well-being, have meaningful conversations about stress or anxiety, and receive personalized coping strategies — 24/7, confidentially, and safely.

It uses AI/ML, psychology-based forms (MHQoL-7D), and a conversational interface to understand users, respond empathetically, and even alert humans when someone might be in crisis.

💡 Key Functionalities

💬 Feature	🧠 What It Does
MHQoL-7D Form	Users answer 7 mental health questions to get a score (used for tracking emotional wellness)
Chat with AI Therapist	Users can chat in natural language about how they feel
Emotion Detection	AI identifies user emotions (e.g., anxious, sad, angry) from the message
RAG System (Smart AI Advice)	AI pulls answers from real therapy resources like CBT guides to provide relevant coping strategies
Reinforcement Learning (RL)	AI improves responses over time based on feedback (👍 or 👎)
Progress Dashboard	Graphs showing user’s emotional progress over time
Crisis Alerts	If someone is in danger, the system triggers alerts (e.g., suicidal intent detection)
