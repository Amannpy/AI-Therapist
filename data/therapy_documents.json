    "summary": "A structured approach that helps identify and change negative thought patterns, improving emotional responses and behaviors.",
    "content": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely-used psychotherapeutic approach focused on identifying and modifying unhelpful thinking patterns and behaviors. The core principle of CBT is that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and negative thoughts can trap us in a cycle of negativity. By identifying distorted thinking patterns (such as catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking, and personalization), CBT helps individuals develop more balanced, realistic thought patterns. Techniques include thought records, behavioral experiments, and gradual exposure to feared situations.",

    "content": "Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an evidence-based program that uses mindfulness meditation to address stress, anxiety, depression, and pain. The practice involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment, observing thoughts and feelings as they arise without getting caught up in them. Regular mindfulness practice has been shown to reduce stress hormones, improve focus, enhance emotional regulation, and promote overall well-being. Key techniques include body scan meditation, sitting meditation, walking meditation, and mindful awareness of daily activities.",

    "summary": "A therapeutic approach that emphasizes accepting difficult emotions while committing to actions aligned with personal values.",
    "content": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a mindfulness-based behavioral therapy that encourages embracing thoughts and feelings rather than fighting or feeling guilty for them. ACT teaches psychological flexibility through six core processes: acceptance, cognitive defusion (learning to perceive thoughts simply as thoughts), being present, self as context, values, and committed action. The goal is not to eliminate difficult feelings but to develop a more accepting relationship with them while building a rich, full, and meaningful life based on personal values.",

    "content": "Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) was originally developed to treat borderline personality disorder but is now used for various conditions involving emotional dysregulation. DBT teaches four key skill sets: mindfulness (staying present), distress tolerance (coping with crises), emotion regulation (managing intense feelings), and interpersonal effectiveness (communicating effectively in relationships). The 'dialectical' component refers to balancing acceptance and changeâ€”accepting oneself while working toward positive change. DBT typically involves individual therapy, skills training groups, phone coaching, and therapist consultation teams.",

    "content": "Positive Psychology shifts focus from treating mental illness to cultivating happiness and well-being. Founded by Martin Seligman, this approach emphasizes five elements known as PERMA: Positive emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment. Positive psychology interventions include practicing gratitude, identifying and using signature strengths, savoring positive experiences, performing acts of kindness, and building optimism. Research shows these practices can increase happiness, reduce depression, and improve overall life satisfaction.",

    "content": "Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) concentrates on finding solutions in the present and exploring hope for the future, rather than analyzing past problems. Therapists help clients identify times when their problems are less severe or absent ('exceptions') and explore what's different during those times. Key techniques include the miracle question ('If a miracle happened and your problem disappeared overnight, how would you know?'), scaling questions to track progress, and identifying existing strengths and resources. SFBT is typically short-term, often requiring only a few sessions.",

    "content": "Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), often called 'tapping,' combines elements of cognitive therapy with acupressure. The approach involves tapping specific meridian points on the body while focusing on negative emotions or physical sensations and using affirmations. Proponents suggest this process helps balance energy systems and reduce distress. While more research is needed, some studies indicate EFT may help with anxiety, PTSD, and certain phobias. The technique is often taught as a self-help tool that clients can use between therapy sessions.",

    "content": "Narrative Therapy views people as separate from their problems and helps them externalize challenging situations rather than internalizing them as part of their identity. The approach helps individuals recognize how cultural contexts and dominant social narratives influence their personal stories. Therapists help clients identify 'sparkling moments' that contradict problem-saturated narratives, develop richer, alternative storylines, and recruit an audience to witness and support their new narratives. The goal is to help people become authors of their own lives and construct preferred identities based on their values and skills.",

IPT was originally developed for depression but is now used for various conditions. The therapy addresses four primary areas: grief (complicated bereavement), role disputes (conflicts with significant others), role transitions (life changes like divorce or job loss), and interpersonal deficits (difficulties forming and maintaining relationships). IPT helps clients improve communication skills, express emotions effectively, and build stronger social support networks.",

    "content": "Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT), developed by Paul Gilbert, helps individuals who experience high levels of shame and self-criticism. Based on evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and Buddhist psychology, CFT suggests we have three emotion regulation systems: threat (protection), drive (achievement), and soothing (connection). People with high shame often have overactive threat systems and underdeveloped soothing systems. CFT uses mindfulness, imagery, and specific exercises to develop self-compassion, helping clients respond to difficulties with kindness rather than self-criticism. Techniques include compassionate mind training, soothing rhythm breathing, and creating a compassionate self-image.",
